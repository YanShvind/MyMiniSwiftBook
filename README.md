# Swift Guide for Beginners and Experienced Programmers

Welcome to my repository! Here you will find useful materials to learn the Swift programming language. The repository contains multiple files, each dedicated to a specific topic in the Swift language.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to help beginners get acquainted with the Swift programming language and to help experienced programmers recall forgotten topics.

## Repository Structure

Each file in the repository is devoted to a specific topic in the Swift language. You will find files for learning the basic principles of the language, such as variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and much more. All materials are aimed at making it easier to learn the Swift language.

## How to Use the Repository

If you are a beginner, I recommend starting with the files describing the basic concepts of the language (for example, `Variables.swift`). Each file contains a description of the topic, code samples, and practical exercises.

For more experienced developers, searching for a file on a topic of interest will be helpful in recalling forgotten language concepts.
